Creating a custom wordpress theme from standard html&css.  There are tips and tricks to remember for the future.  Enjoy

1. A new wordpress theme requires an index.php file and a style.css file to be noticed on the backend.

2. A note about php: if you just have php in a .php file, then you only need a single opening php tag (<?php) at the top of the document.  If you have html and all that other bullshit, you'll need a closing tag.

3. When adding a function to the "functions.php" file, always remember to add the action to the (tentatively named) action pallete via this code:

4. When linking to css using functions.php, make sure that <?php wp_footer(); ?> AND <?php wp_head(); ?> are inserted before the closing body tag and the closing head tag respectively.

5. You can link to any asset using this php tag: <?php bloginfo('template_url'); ?>

The basic idea is that this tag refers to the theme's parent directory and then you can work your way down from there using regular path notation.

But remember, this is still an image src attribute; everything inside of it must be in quotes or you may get errors.
